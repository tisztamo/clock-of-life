This is a wall clock implemented in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conway's
Game of Life</a>. You can run it on a Raspberry Pi 3 or similar.

### Embedding

TODO This section is a stub. 

I run it on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B using Chromium kiosk mode.
You have to configure the JavaScript heap with command line flags.
Use clock.sh to start the browser.  

### Thanks

The original clockwork was designed by dim (<a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/88783/build-a-digital-clock-in-conways-game-of-life/" target="_blank">see the post</a>),
I only tuned it a bit.

The player is based on <a href="https://github.com/copy/life" target="_blank">life</a> by copy.
